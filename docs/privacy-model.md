# Differential Privacy Model

`get_private_aggregate_score` provides an ε-differentially-private variant of
the cross-asset aggregate risk score query.  The noise mechanism is the
**discrete Laplace mechanism** (the integer analogue of the classic Laplace
mechanism), calibrated to sensitivity 100 — the full output range of the
aggregate score (0–100).

## Definition

A randomised query `M` satisfies **ε-differential privacy** if for all
adjacent databases `D` and `D'` (differing by a single wallet's score), and
for all output sets `S`:

```
Pr[M(D) ∈ S] ≤ exp(ε) × Pr[M(D') ∈ S]

The privacy budget `ε` controls the privacy–utility trade-off:
lower values provide stronger privacy guarantees but add more noise.

## Noise Mechanism

### Laplace Inverse‑CDF Sampling

Noise is drawn from a discrete Laplace distribution `Lap(0, b)` with scale

```
b = sensitivity / ε = 100 / ε

using the inverse-CDF (quantile) method:

```
noise = sign × Lap_magnitude
sign = ±1 with equal probability
magnitude = floor(b × (−ln(u)))

where `u` is a uniform random variate in `(0, 1)`.  This is the standard
**geometric mechanism** for integer-valued queries.

### Deterministic PRNG (not cryptographic privacy)

On-chain smart contracts have no access to true entropy.  Instead, the noise
is derived from a **deterministic pseudo-random function** of the ledger
sequence number (a monotonically increasing value that changes each ledger
close) plus a caller-provided `seed` argument:

```text
prng = SHA-256(ledger_seq || seed || sensitivity || epsilon_scaled || "DPRN")
```yaml

This means:

- **Reproducible** — calling `get_private_aggregate_score` at the same
  ledger sequence with the same `seed` produces identical output, which
  makes integration testing predictable.
- **Non-repeating across ledgers** — unless the caller reuses the same
  `seed` on the same ledger sequence, the noise will differ.
- **Caller-controlled seed** — callers can supply different `seed` values
  even within the same ledger to obtain independent noise samples.

This mechanism is not a source of secret randomness. The ledger sequence,
seed, epsilon, and contract code are observable, so an observer with ledger
access can reproduce the exact noise and subtract it from the returned score.
Consequently, this function must not be used to protect an aggregate score
from validators, ledger observers, or any party that can reconstruct these
inputs. A genuine privacy guarantee requires noise generated off-chain with
secret entropy, or a commit-reveal protocol that keeps the entropy hidden
until the result is fixed.

### Clamping

Noise is clamped to `±3 × b` (i.e. `±3 × sensitivity / ε`) before being
added to the exact aggregate score.  The final noised result is clamped to
`[0, 100]` to stay within the valid score range.

## Configuration

| Function | Parameter | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `set_privacy_epsilon(epsilon_scaled)` | `epsilon_scaled = ε × 100` | Admin sets the privacy budget. `100` → ε = 1.0, `1` → ε = 0.01. `0` disables noise. |
| `get_privacy_epsilon()` | — | Returns the current `epsilon_scaled` value. Defaults to `0` (no privacy). |

## Sensitivity

The L1 sensitivity of the aggregate score query is **100** — the full output
range.  Because the aggregate is a weighted average of per-pair scores each
bounded to [0, 100], changing a single wallet's score by at most 100 can
change the average by at most 100.  Using the full range as sensitivity is
conservative (it slightly over-estimates the true sensitivity for wallets
with many pairs) and ensures the mechanism satisfies ε-DP regardless of the
number of asset pairs.

## Usage

```rust
// Query private aggregate
let private_score: u32 = client.get_private_aggregate_score(&wallet, &seed);

## Limits and Caveats

1. **Deterministic PRNG is not a privacy boundary.** An adversary who knows
  the contract source code and the ledger state can reproduce the noise value
  exactly. The on-chain result therefore does not provide differential privacy
  against observers with ledger access. Use off-chain secret entropy or a
  commit-reveal protocol when that threat model matters.

2. **ε is a parameter, not a proof.**  The contract does not enforce a
   privacy budget composition bound (e.g., no sequential composition
   tracking).  Integrators calling `get_private_aggregate_score` multiple
   times for the same wallet will accumulate a total privacy spend of
   `k × ε` after `k` queries (by sequential composition).  Calling
   contracts should track their own privacy budget if they need a
   bounded total spend.

3. **Round‑off from clamping.**  When the noise is large enough to push the
  result outside [0, 100], clamping truncates the distribution. The output
  remains within the valid score range, but clamping does not restore privacy
  against observers who can reconstruct the deterministic noise.

4. **No per‑pair private query.**  Only the cross-asset aggregate query
   (`get_private_aggregate_score`) has a private variant.  The per-pair
   `get_score` query is exact and not noise-calibrated.

## Deletion-policy note

Privacy-related score deletion is now intentionally separated from routine
admin rights. `clear_score` and `clear_score_history` can be placed behind an
explicit deletion-approval policy so normal governance operators cannot perform
irreversible deletion without the separately configured high-risk approver.

## Example

```text
sensitivity = 100
ε = 1.0       →  epsilon_scaled = 100
b = 100 / 1.0 = 100

Noise bounds: ±300

Exact score:  70
Noised score: 70 + Lap(0, 100) → e.g. 42 or 91
              (always clamped to [0, 100])
```yaml

## Irreversible score deletion operations

`clear_score` and `clear_score_history` are intentionally destructive operator
tools. Before the changes for issues #791 and #792, the concrete behavior was:

- both calls were admin-only and no-op on missing data;
- `clear_score` removed only the latest `Score(wallet, pair)` entry;
- `clear_score_history` removed only the `ScoreHistory(wallet, pair)` ring;
- each path updated the histogram using only the current latest score when one
  existed;
- the emitted events (`clr_scr`, `clr_hist`) contained only the wallet topic
  and the asset pair payload, so operators had no hashed reason/category or
  auth-context evidence on chain.

The current operator workflow is:

1. Call `get_deletion_preflight(wallet, pair)` to inspect the deletion scope.
2. Execute `clear_score*` or `clear_score_history*`.
3. Persist the unhashed case notes off chain if a human-readable record is
   required.

### Preflight output

`get_deletion_preflight` is read-only and returns:

- `wallet`
- `asset_pair`
- `latest_score_present`
- `history_count`
- `audit_warning = Irreversible`

This preview intentionally avoids touching the history TTL, so operators can
inspect the target without mutating its retention horizon.

### Audit trail shape

`clr_scr` and `clr_hist` keep their existing topic shape
`(event_name, EVENT_VERSION, wallet)` but now append richer payload data:

- `asset_pair`
- `by` (the configured admin address)
- `latest_score_present`
- `history_count`
- `reason_hash = sha256(reason_bytes)`
- `category_hash = sha256(category_bytes)`
- `multisig_enabled`
- `signer_count`
- `threshold`

Raw deleted `RiskScore` values are still excluded from the event payload.

For backwards-compatible callers, `clear_score` and `clear_score_history`
continue to exist and emit deterministic default hashes for
`reason = "unspecified"` and categories `"score-clear"` / `"history-clear"`.
Operators that want case-specific hashes can call
`clear_score_with_audit(...)` or `clear_score_history_with_audit(...)`.

### Compatibility impact

- Public ABI: additive only. Existing delete entrypoints are preserved; new
  preflight and `*_with_audit` functions are optional.
- Event topics: unchanged.
- Event payloads: append-only expansion of `clr_scr` / `clr_hist`.
- Errors: unchanged.
- Storage layout: unchanged. No new persistent deletion log is stored on chain.

### Resource bounds

- `history_count` is derived from the bounded score-history ring, whose maximum
  depth remains `MAX_HISTORY_DEPTH = 50`.
- Batch submission boundaries remain capped at `MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 20`.
- The worst relevant cases are therefore still bounded by existing constants,
  and the existing batch/history TTL tests and benches remain the governing
  budget references for these paths.
